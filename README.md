# StringCompiler
A general translation library that allows the programmer to specify a grammar of type and inference rules.

#Author
Bryce Summers is the author of this code. Many great computer scientists, mathematiscians, computer engineers, and programmers as well as many other people probably created technology such as the invention of the computer that I used in the proccess.

#Inspiration
I was inspired to write this software while taking a course on logic, Undecidability, and Incompleteness.

#Why should I use this Project?
This project can be used for many things such as using inference rules to derive canonical strings for use in automatic grading systems. If this StringCompiler were used then automatic grading systems could be less strict in the input that the accept as correct.

#Current State:

List types and tuple types are working pretty well.

I have two perfectly working example and a predicate logic example that has two test cases that do not parse correctly.

There are still probably many bugs floating around. This project is by no means done yet.

#A Liscense that I am trying out.
