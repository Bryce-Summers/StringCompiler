/* The Bryce Iterator Interface.
 * 
 * Written by Bryce Summers on 7 - 28 - 2013.
 * 
 * Purpose : This class specifies powerful iterators that can move forward and backward and perform removals and insertions.
 * 
 * This will allow me to dynamically keep track of a location in objects such as lists.
 * 
 *	In lists, this allows me to create text boxes that support a pointer,
 *  with left and right movement capabilities and the ability to delete and insert elements inside of the list.
 *  
 *  
 *  NOTE : In other words, once a user has extracted an IterB, the IterB acts like a data structure that is perfect for Text Editing.
 *  
 *  // FIXME : Perhaps give it a better name.
 *  // FIXME : Implement the Data_structure signature?????
